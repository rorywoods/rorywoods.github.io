Windows 8.1 introduces a unified search. Files, Settings and the Web (via Bing) can be searched from the Search Charm or Start Screen.

Win 8.1 app start: Win key, start typing, arrow down to app, web search results load, first item re-selects, press enter, start wrong app
Fix: Charms bar > Settings > Change PC Settings > Turn Off "Use Bing to search online"
